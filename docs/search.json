    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;."

Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

Quite a hot topic these days, it seems.\nThroughout this post, I’ll use our study as an example to illustrate crucial steps of a meta-analysis. These include (i) the systematic literature search, (ii) standardized effect sizes, and (iii) meta-analytic models.\nThe idea is for this to be a hands-on introduction, so try to follow the instructions and perform parts of these steps yourself. I hope this will help you understood how a (very basic kind of) meta-analysis works, and give you some idea on how to perform one yourself."

Results of single studies can be affected by a ton of factors, e.g. the country they were run in, the experimental setup the researchers, the sample they recruit and so on. But if we average across many studies on the same thing, we get a more robust, generalizable result. And comparing many studies, we might even get an idea of specific factors that are systematically associated with differences."

These studies typically look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of items used by Pennycook et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants see a bunch of news headlines, sometimes with a lede and source, as they would appear on social media typically. Some of these headlines are false (typically identified as such by fact-checking sites such as Snopes), and some of them are true. For each news headline, they are asked to which extent they believe the headline to be accurate, (e.g. “To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim in the above headline” 1 = Not at all accurate, 4 = Very accurate).\nIn order to do a meta-analysis, we need to have some quantifying measure for our research question. In this case, it is pretty straightforward. Researchers refer to people’s capacity to tell true news from false news as news discernment, which is simply:\n\\[\n\\text{discernment} = \\text{mean accuracy}_{\\text{true news}} - \\text{mean accuracy}_{\\text{false news}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe have a research question, and we also already have an idea of a quantifiable answer. At this point, we would ideally write up a pre-registration. This is basically a plan for our meta-analysis project, including the literature search and analysis plan, but a plan that we commit to making public.\nHowever, it is hard to write up a pre-registration for a meta-analysis if you don’t know anything about a meta-analysis. So we’ll skip this step for now and jump right into effect sizes."

    "text": "II Effect sizes\nIt might feel weird to talk about standardized effect sizes before the systematic literature search. But only if we know how to calculate (standardized) effect sizes, we can know what exactly we are looking for in articles.\nWe want to be able to compare discernment across studies. The problem is: different studies use different measurement scales. For example, Dias, Pennycook, and Rand (2020) use a 4-point scale, while Roozenbeek et al. (2020) use a 7-point scale. How can we compare the results of the two?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nref\nmean_accuracy_true\nmean_accuracy_fake\naccuracy_scale_numeric\ndiscernment\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n2.57\n1.67\n4\n0.90\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n5.40\n2.49\n7\n2.91\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution are standardized effect sizes. Instead of expressing discernment on the original scale of the study, we express discernment in terms of standard deviations. All we have to do is divide the discernment score by the (pooled) standard deviation of true and false news. So on top of the mean ratings, we also need the standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\n\nref\nmean_accuracy_true\nsd_accuracy_true\nmean_accuracy_fake\nsd_accuracy_fake\naccuracy_scale_numeric\ndiscernment\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n2.57\n0.52\n1.67\n0.42\n4\n0.90\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n5.40\n1.62\n2.49\n1.34\n7\n2.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized discernment measure that we are after is generally referred to as a standardized mean difference (SMD), with perhaps the most popular version being called Cohen’s d, named after the psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen.\nCohen’s d is calculate as\n\\[\n\\text{Cohen's d} = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{true}} - \\bar{x}_{\\text{false}}}{SD_{\\text{pooled}}}\n\\] with\n\\[\nSD_{\\text{pooled}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{SD_{\\text{true}}^2+SD_{\\text{false}}^2}{2}}\n\\]\nUsing these formula, we can now calculate our standardized discernment measure.\n\npooled_sd &lt;- function(sd_true, sd_false) {\n  sd_pooled &lt;- sqrt((sd_true^2 + sd_false^2) / 2)\n  return(sd_pooled)\n}\n\nmeta &lt;- meta %&gt;% \n  mutate(discernment = mean_accuracy_true - mean_accuracy_fake,\n         pooled_sd = pooled_sd(sd_accuracy_true, sd_accuracy_fake), \n         discernment_std = discernment/pooled_sd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nref\nmean_accuracy_true\nmean_accuracy_fake\nsd_accuracy_fake\naccuracy_scale_numeric\nsd_accuracy_true\ndiscernment\npooled_sd\ndiscernment_std\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n2.57\n1.67\n0.42\n4\n0.52\n0.90\n0.4726521\n1.904149\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n5.40\n2.49\n1.34\n7\n1.62\n2.91\n1.4866069\n1.957478\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! We are almost ready to go to the next step and talk about meta-analytic models. But before that, there’s one thing missing still: the standard error (SE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStandard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD) are not the same thing. SD measures the variability observed within a sample. In our case, e.g. distribution accuracy ratings of fake news. It can be calculated directly from the data. SE describes the variability of a (hypothetical) distribution of an effect. In our case, e.g. a distribution of mean accuracy ratings of fake news, each based on a different sample. We can only guess this distribution based on the data by relying on statistical theory.\n\n\nThe SE is like a measure of certainty. How certain can we be that we observe a certain discernment effect in a study not only because of sampling variation (e.g. the specific sample of participants we asked), but because there is actually a true effect in the population (in all people)? The bigger the sample, the smaller the SE, i.e. the more certain we can be that whatever we observe is actually representative of the population we want to make conclusions on.\n\\[\nSE_{\\text{Cohen's d}} = SD_{\\text{pooled}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_\\text{true}}+\\frac{1}{n_\\text{false}}}\n\\]\nwith \\(n_\\text{false}\\) being the sample size of fake news items, \\(n_\\text{true}\\) the sample size of true news items in group 1, and \\(SD_{\\text{pooled}}\\) the pooled standard deviation of both groups (see above).\nIn our case, things are a bit tricky. Usually, in studies of news judgements, participants rate both false and true news items, and several of each category. First, this means that technically, we have to calculate the SE slightly differently. In the SE formula above, we were assuming independence of true and false news ratings. But the distributions of false and true news are necessarily correlated, because they are coming from the same participants. For this tutorial, we will ignore this. Second, our n are all instances of news ratings, i.e. is the product of the number of participants in our study (n_subj) and the number of news ratings per participant (n_news).\n\n\n\n\n\nref\nn_subj\nn_news\nn\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n187\n24\n4488\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n700\n8\n5600\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this information, we can now calculate the SE. In our case, n is the combined number of rating instances. Let’s just assume that participant saw equally many false news as true news, so that we have \\(n_\\text{true} = n_\\text{false} = n/2\\)\n\nSE_Cohens_d &lt;- function(sd_pooled, n_true, n_false) {\n  se_d &lt;- sd_pooled * sqrt((1 / n_true) + (1 / n_false))\n  return(se_d)\n}\n\nmeta &lt;- meta %&gt;% \n  mutate(discernment_SE = SE_Cohens_d(sd_pooled = pooled_sd, n_true = n/2, n_false = n/2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nref\npooled_sd\nn\ndiscernment_std\ndiscernment_SE\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n0.4726521\n4488\n1.904149\n0.0141106\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n1.4866069\n5600\n1.957478\n0.0397312\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay! Now that we have an effect size and its SE, we could run a meta-analysis.\nIf this was a bit tedious, here’s some good news: We do not have to do this by hand every time. There are several R packages specifically dedicated to meta-analysis that you can use. For example, the metafor package has a function called escalc() to calculate various effect sizes that are commonly used in meta-analyses. Here is an example of how to do what we just did using escalc:\n\nlibrary(metafor)\n\n# Calculate SMD and its variance\nmeta_effect_sizes &lt;- escalc(measure = \"SMD\", \n                  # diff = true (m1i) - fake (m2i)\n                  m1i=mean_accuracy_true,\n                  sd1i=sd_accuracy_true, \n                  m2i= mean_accuracy_fake, \n                  sd2i=sd_accuracy_fake, \n                  n1i = n_observations/2,\n                  n2i = n_observations/2, \n                  data = meta)\n\n# View the resulting data frame with effect sizes and variances\nmeta_effect_sizes %&gt;% \n  select(ref, starts_with(\"mean\"), yi, vi) %&gt;% \n  mutate(SE = sqrt(vi)) %&gt;% \n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nref\nmean_accuracy_fake\nmean_accuracy_true\nyi\nvi\nSE\n\n\n\n\nDias_2020\n1.67\n2.57\n1.903831\n0.0012928\n0.0359551\n\n\nRoozenbeek_2020\n2.49\n5.40\n1.957216\n0.0010563\n0.0325010\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this output, yiis the SDM (i.e. our standardized discernment effect), and vi is the variance (which is just \\(SE^2\\)). The values for SE are not exactly the same we obtained when calculating Cohen’s D by hand before, because escalc() uses not Cohen’s D, but Hedges’ G (a very similar measure but with some small sample correction).\nThere are many more standardized effect sizes. Which one you want to use depends mostly on the kind of data you want to analyze. For dichotomous outcomes, researchers typically use (log) odds or risk ratios, for associations between two continuous variables simply a correlation1 and so on. There is a great introduction to doing meta-analysis by Harrer et al. (2021). The book is freely available online and includes r-code. There is a whole chapter on effect sizes which you might want to look at.\nWe know have an idea of what we need to extract from the papers, in order to be able to run a meta-analysis:\n\nthe means and standard deviations of false and true news ratings, respectively.\nthe number of participants and the number of news ratings per participant\n\nWith that in mind, we are ready to dive into the literature search."

    "text": "III Systematic literature search\nIdeally, we want all studies that have ever been written on our research question. Remember, the more the better. There’s just one issue: try to type something like “misinformation” or “fake news” in google scholar.\n\n\n\nScreenshot from a google scholar search on June 27, 2024\n\n\nUps. Not enough time to review all these in a life time probably. The first thing we should do is be a bit more specific in what we’re looking for. So let’s refine our search string.\n\nSearch string\nYou will most likely never start a systematic literature review having absolutely no clue about the topic you care about. There might at least be that one paper that inspired your idea for a meta-analysis. This paper gives you some first ideas of keywords that you could look for.\nIn our case, we settled on this search string\n\n‘“false news” OR “fake news” OR “false stor*” AND “accuracy” OR “discernment” OR “credibilit*” OR “belief” OR “susceptib*”’\n\nThere are a couple of things here. We used ’OR’s and ’AND’s to combine words. These are Boolean operators. Quick quizz:\n\n\n\nImagine we would have run a title-search (i.e. not searching abstracts or other content, but only the headlines of articles). Would this search string have yielded a study called “News accuracy ratings of US adults during 2016 presidential elections”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean AND operator. Only if both keywords are included, a result will show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean OR operator. As long as one of the keywords is included, a result will show up.\n\n\n\n\nNo. And that is because of the boolean operators. The “OR” operator tells the search engine that as long as one of the keywords is matched, return the result. By contrast, the AND operator tells the search engine, that both keywords need to be matched. For example, “accuracy” OR “discernment” would return an article entitled “News accuracy ratings of US adults during 2016 presidential elections”, whereas “accuracy” AND “discernment” would not.\nInstead of single keywords, you can also link combinations of keywords. Our search string, put a bit more abstractly, reads …OR…OR…AND…Or…OR… As in math, there is a hierarchy among operators. On Scopus (the search engine we used), OR operators are treated before AND operators. It’s like in math, when you know that \\(1 + 2*4 = 9\\), because you multiply before you add. You could re-write the math term \\(1 + (2*4) = 9\\) to make the convention explicit, and you could do the same for the search string (…OR…OR…) AND (…Or…OR…), but you don’t have to.\nImagine that we are happy with the combination of keywords that we have in our search string. Where do we look for articles now?\n\n\nData bases\nYou will all know Google Scholar, which is very convenient for quick searches. We all use it regularly to find a specific article that we are looking for, or to get a first impression of results from some keywords.\nThe one big disadvantage for google scholar is that the results (and least in terms of order) are user-specific. You and I running the same search query on google scholar, results will not be listed in the same way. This is problematic, because literature of a systematic review should ideally be reproducible.\nLuckily, there are loads of other data bases that you can search. Some of them are issue specific (e.g. Pubmed for medicine in the broadest sense) while others are more general (e.g. Scopus, Web of Science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost of these databases will miss non-published data. Researchers still have a hard time of publishing null findings, and very recent pre-prints have not yet made it through peer-review. Only searching peer-reviewed, published records might therefor bias your selection of studies. To counteract, you can additionally search on pre-print servers, e.g. PsyArXiv for psychology.\n\n\nIn our case, say we want to search Scopus, a very large and general data base.\n\nWe can enter our search term, and specify what parts of the articles we want to search for. We will pick Article title, Abstract & Keywords.\nOnce we click on search, we see the number of overall search results, and a list of articles.\n\nThe number of results is less shocking than the initial one from searching “misinformation” on Google Scholar. But it is still a whole lot of articles, and we couldn’t possibly read all of them entirely.\nWe can use some more refined criteria to filter out some likely irrelevant results2. In the left hand panel, we can select for example the document type, language, or subject areas. We can exclude, for example, a couple of disciplines that are most likely not relevant, such as “Chemistry”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more restrictions we make, the more it will reduce the number of search results. You will also not that adding these restrictions changes the search string (you can see the full string by clicking on the orange “Advanced query” button).\n\nIf we’re finally happy with our search, we need to save the search results somewhere3. Some people like to export all results to a reference manager such as Zotero. For our project, I preferred not to flood my Zotero and use the convenient options to export search results to a .csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean AND operator. Only if both keywords are included, a result will show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean OR operator. As long as one of the keywords is included, a result will show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to run your own literature search:\n\nFind a partner\nMake up a search string\nRun it on Scopus\nRestrict search results\nDownload a .csv file with the first 100 results\n\n\n\nNow that we have all results stored, there are still many, many articles. Do we have to read them all? No. Before we start reading entire papers, we do screening.\n\n\nScreening\nThere are usually two stages of screening: (i) title screening and (ii) abstract screening. Since screening decisions can sometimes be quite arbitrary, we ideally want several researchers to do it independently.\n\nTitle screening\nDuring title screening we throw out titles that are very obviously not relevant.\n\n\n\nDo your:\n\nStay with your partner\nUpload your .csv search result file in a google spreadsheet\nLimit your spreadsheet to the first 30 results.\nMake a new tab and copy only the title column. Make a second column called “reviewer”. Make a third column “decision”. Duplicate this tab.\nEach reviewer screens all titles independently. Put your respective initals in all cells of the “reviewer column”. Agree on a code for in/exclusion in the “decision” column.\nCompare with your partner and explain cases of exclusion\n\n\n\nThere will almost certainly be some cases where you and your co-reviewer will not agree.4.\nOne, conservative solution to proceed is to only remove titles that all reviewers found to be irrelevant, and make all others pass through to the next screening stage.\n\n\nAbstract screening\nThe next stage, abstract screening, is a bit more challenging. At this point, the any search result that we retained might be relevant to review for us. That means, from now on, we really need to justify why we include some articles, but not others.\nHere are some criteria that we can set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterionID\nCriterion_type\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n1.0\nDocument type\nAll literature with original data: peer reviewed papers, but also pre-prints (this implies unique data that is not otherwise already included in the analysis)\n\n\n2.0\nResearch question\nis about the perceived accuracy of fake AND true news\n\n\n3.0\nAccess\nis the paper available\n\n\n4.0\nMethod\nmeasures accuracy or an equivalent construct (e.g. trustworthiness, truthfulness)\n\n\n4.1\nMethod\nprovides all relevant summary statistics (i.e. accuracy ratings for both fake AND true news) or data to produce them; a mere discernment score is not enough\n\n\n4.2\nMethod\nprovides a clear control condition that is comparable with those of other studies\n\n\n5.0\nStimuli\nreal world news only\n\n\n\n\n\nThese inclusion5 criteria are very important. For every article that we reject after the title screening, we use them to justify why we excluded them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe restrictions we made on our data base are technically also inclusion criteria.

    "section": "IV Meta-analysis",
    "text": "IV Meta-analysis\nHere’s an intuitive way to think about a meta-analysis: We just take the effect sizes of all the studies and then calculate an some average. That average, we hope, is closer to the “true effect” than any of the single studies.\nThe problem is: Some studies have a way larger sample than others. Our average should take this into account–in other words, what we want is a weighted average. The bigger the sample–and thus the smaller the standard error–the more weight a study should have.\n\nFixed-effect vs. Random-effect model\nThe way we calculate these weights is where things become a bit philosophical. There are two models to conceive of our study effect sizes: (i) a fixed effect model and (ii) a random effects model. The fixed-effect model assumes that there is one “true” effect only. Effect sizes vary from one study to another, but only becasue sampling variation. The random-effects model assumes that there are several “true” effects. Studies vary because of sampling variation, but also because they have different “true” effects.\nIf this sounds confusing, you’re not alone. I like to imagine it like this: Imagine you run the same study on news-discernment both in the US and in China. You get very different results. According to the fixed-effect model, these are two samples from the same population–all people–and there is one true value for news discernment capacity across the globe. According to the random-effects model, there these are two different populations, who have two distinct true values for news discernment capacity.\nIf this still isn’t clear (I wouldn’t blame you), you can give this chapter a read. The take away is that for many meta-analyses (at least in social sciences), a random-effects model is probably the better choice.\n\n“[…] there may be countless reasons why real differences exist in the true effect sizes of studies. The random-effects model addresses this concern. It provides us with a model that often reflects the reality behind our data much better.” (Harrer et al. 2021)\n\n\n\nWeighted averages\nRemember that our meta-analysis ultimately leaves us with some sort of weighted average. We want studies with larger samples (and thus smaller SEs, or sampling variation) to have more weight.\nThe most common approach to do this is often called inverse-variance weighting or simply inverse-variance meta-analysis (Harrer et al. 2021).\n\\[\nw_k = \\frac{1}{s^2_k}\n\\] where \\(w_k\\) is the weight for each study \\(k\\) and \\(s^2_k\\) is the variance (the squared standard error) of each effect size.\nBased on these weights, the meta-analytic average is calculated as the sum of weighted effect sizes divided by the sum o fall individual weights\n\\[\n\\hat\\theta = \\frac{\\sum^{K}_{k=1} \\hat\\theta_kw_k}{\\sum^{K}_{k=1} w_k}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\hat\\theta\\) estimate of the true pooled effect and \\(\\hat\\theta_k\\) each study’s effect size.\nFor the random effects model, it’s a little more difficult. It assumes that on top of the sampling variation, there is also other “random” variance \\(\\tau^2\\), or tau-squared.\n\\[\nw^*_k = \\frac{1}{s^2_k+\\tau^2}\n\\] Estimating \\(\\tau^2\\) is possible but but complex. Luckily, there are packages that do this for us. After determining the correct weight, random-effects models typically also use the same approach of inverse variance method as described above.\nLet’s try an example of how to do a random-effects meta-analysis with the metafor package. Before we can run a meta-analysis, we need to make sure to have a data-frame with effect sizes.\n\n\n\nHere is a spreadsheet.\n\nDownload it.\nCalculate effect sizes using the escalc() function from the metafor package.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(metafor)\n\nmeta &lt;- read_csv(\"data/meta_randomeffects_example.csv\")\n\n# Calculate SMD and its variance\nmeta_effect_sizes &lt;- escalc(measure = \"SMD\", \n                  # diff = true (m1i) - fake (m2i)\n                  m1i=mean_accuracy_true,\n                  sd1i=sd_accuracy_true, \n                  m2i= mean_accuracy_fake, \n                  sd2i=sd_accuracy_fake, \n                  n1i = n/2,\n                  n2i = n/2, \n                  data = meta) %&gt;% \n  arrange(yi)\n\n# View the resulting data frame \nmeta_effect_sizes %&gt;% \n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaperID\nref\nmean_accuracy_fake\nmean_accuracy_true\nsd_accuracy_fake\nsd_accuracy_true\nn\nyi\nvi\n\n\n\n\n7\nGuess_2020\n2.40\n2.77\n0.729\n0.694\n19638\n0.5198510\n0.0002106\n\n\n1\nAltay_2022\n1.99\n2.71\n0.890\n0.880\n2990\n0.8133421\n0.0014484\n\n\n2\nLutzke_2019\n4.28\n6.38\n2.550\n2.340\n5604\n0.8579899\n0.0007795\n\n\n10\nLuo_2022\n2.98\n4.72\n1.950\n2.010\n1150\n0.8781128\n0.0038135\n\n\n4\nPennycook_2020\n1.95\n2.64\n0.600\n0.530\n4020\n1.2186749\n0.0011797\n\n\n8\nPennycook_2020_b\n0.33\n0.65\n0.280\n0.220\n12795\n1.2708078\n0.0003757\n\n\n9\nClayton_2020\n1.96\n3.34\n0.934\n0.927\n4221\n1.4827995\n0.0012081\n\n\n3\nPennycook_2018\n1.78\n2.83\n0.600\n0.700\n2847\n1.6102018\n0.0018603\n\n\n6\nPennycook_2019\n1.66\n2.59\n0.450\n0.440\n63456\n2.0897310\n0.0000974\n\n\n5\nBronstein_2019\n1.79\n2.78\n0.460\n0.470\n12048\n2.1287766\n0.0005201\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the effect sizes, we can now run our meta-analysis.\n\nresult &lt;- metafor::rma(yi, vi, data = meta_effect_sizes, slab = ref)\nmetafor::forest(result)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYay.

In the bottom row, we see the row label “RE Model”, for random-effects model, the value for our meta-analytic average.\n\n\nMulti-level\nSo far so good. Things get more complicated if we have more than one effect size per study, and perhaps even per sample within a study. For our studies, this is the case.\nOne of the reasons is that participants did not only see several news items, but sometimes also news items of different categories, such as politically concordant (e.g. pro-republican news for a Republican participant) and discordant (e.g. pro-democrat news for a Republican participant).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaperID\nref\nsampleID\nnews_family\nn\nyi\nvi\n\n\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n3\npolitically_discordant\n320.00\n-0.2660372\n0.0126106\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n12\npolitically_concordant\n400.00\n-0.2505704\n0.0100785\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n6\npolitically_concordant\n320.00\n-0.1423425\n0.0125317\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n9\npolitically_discordant\n400.00\n0.0000000\n0.0100000\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n9\npolitically_concordant\n400.00\n0.0854359\n0.0100091\n\n\n69\nShirikov_2024\n3\npolitically_concordant\n72880.48\n0.1293124\n0.0000550\n\n\n56\nGarrett_2021\n1\npolitically_concordant\n2212.00\n0.1371033\n0.0018126\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n6\npolitically_discordant\n320.00\n0.1396615\n0.0125305\n\n\n69\nShirikov_2024\n3\npolitically_discordant\n72880.48\n0.1771236\n0.0000551\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n12\npolitically_discordant\n400.00\n0.1784714\n0.0100398\n\n\n69\nShirikov_2024\n4\npolitically_discordant\n14625.28\n0.2161790\n0.0002751\n\n\n69\nShirikov_2024\n4\npolitically_concordant\n14625.28\n0.2523929\n0.0002757\n\n\n58\nLyons_2024\n1\npolitically_discordant\n4848.00\n0.2843118\n0.0008334\n\n\n58\nLyons_2024\n1\npolitically_concordant\n4842.00\n0.3126600\n0.0008362\n\n\n58\nLyons_2024\n3\npolitically_discordant\n4701.00\n0.3145489\n0.0008614\n\n\n58\nLyons_2024\n3\npolitically_concordant\n4692.00\n0.3325030\n0.0008643\n\n\n64\nGuess_2024\n5\npolitically_concordant\n810.00\n0.3376436\n0.0050086\n\n\n55\nGawronski_2023\n2\npolitically_discordant\n8850.00\n0.3398163\n0.0004585\n\n\n58\nLyons_2024\n1\npolitically_discordant\n4788.00\n0.3517364\n0.0008483\n\n\n64\nGuess_2024\n5\npolitically_discordant\n810.00\n0.3631048\n0.0050197\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, for each sample, we have two observations, i.e two lines in our data frame. Because observations are not independent of each other, and a standard meta-analysis assumes independence, we have to find a way of modelling this dependency. This is where multi-level meta-analysis becomes relevant.\nIn fact, the standard random-effects model that we’ve learned about already is a multi-level model. It has two levels of variation: the sampling variance (the SE), and some unique study variance (what we labeled ‘tau’). Now we want to add an additional level between these two, namely some unique sample variance.\nThere is a great chapter on multi-level models in Harrer et al. (2021). The key take-away is that as soon as there are dependencies in our data frame, we need to model them. If effect sizes are correlated and we do not model the sources of that correlation, this can artificially reduce the heterogeniety of our effect sizes and lead to false-positive results (Harrer et al. 2021). For example, if we run ten studies but 8 on them rely on the same 100 participants, we might find results that are very similar across studies, but that’s precisely because they can hardly be seen as independent studies.\nImplementing a multilevel meta-analysis with the metafor package in R is pretty intuitive, if you have the habit of running linear mixed-models. The syntax is very similar.\nFirst, we crate add an observation_id to our data frame, which identifies each row, i.e. each effect size in our sample. We then create a unique_sample_id, which is a combination of the ref and the sampleID variable.\n\nmeta &lt;- meta %&gt;% \n  mutate(observation_id = 1:nrow(.), \n         unique_sample_id = paste0(ref, sampleID))\n\nhead(meta) %&gt;% \n  kable() %&gt;%\n  column_spec(c(8, 9), background = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\npaperID\nref\nsampleID\nnews_family\nn\nyi\nvi\nobservation_id\nunique_sample_id\n\n\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n3\npolitically_discordant\n320.00\n-0.2660372\n0.0126106\n1\nEun-Ju_20233\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n12\npolitically_concordant\n400.00\n-0.2505704\n0.0100785\n2\nEun-Ju_202312\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n6\npolitically_concordant\n320.00\n-0.1423425\n0.0125317\n3\nEun-Ju_20236\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n9\npolitically_discordant\n400.00\n0.0000000\n0.0100000\n4\nEun-Ju_20239\n\n\n41\nEun-Ju_2023\n9\npolitically_concordant\n400.00\n0.0854359\n0.0100091\n5\nEun-Ju_20239\n\n\n69\nShirikov_2024\n3\npolitically_concordant\n72880.48\n0.1293124\n0.0000550\n6\nShirikov_20243\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then proceed and run our multi-level model.\n\n# Multilevel random effect model for accuracy\nmultilevel_model &lt;-  metafor::rma.mv(yi, vi, random = ~ 1 | unique_sample_id / observation_id, data=meta)\n\nOne additional thing, which I will not further discuss unfortunately, but which you should know about (you can look here for more info): Multi-level models do not account for dependencies in sampling error. But when one same sample contributes several effect sizes, we should expect their respective sampling errors to be correlated (Harrer et al. 2021), too. To account for dependency in sampling errors, you should compute cluster-robust standard errors.\n\nrobust_multilevel_model &lt;- metafor::robust(multilevel_model, cluster = unique_sample_id)\n\n\n\nMeta-regression\nIn meta-analyses, we often want to go beyond mere averages. We also like to know what factors contribute to the differences we observe between effect sizes. Meta-regressions allow us to do exactly that.\nThe good new is that this is pretty easy to implement and understand (at after having worked our brains to try to understand multi-level models). It works just like any normal regression analysis.\nLet’s say we want to know differences in discernment associated with political concordance. All we have to do is add a term for that variable to our model.\n\n# Multilevel random effect model for accuracy\nmeta_regression_model &lt;-  metafor::rma.mv(yi, vi, \n                                          # you can also add multiple covariates\n                                          mods = ~news_family, \n                                          random = ~ 1 | unique_sample_id / observation_id, \n                                          data=meta)\n\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(meta_regression_model, \n                           stars = TRUE)\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                (1)\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n        \n                \n                  intercept                        \n                  0.595***\n                \n                \n                                                   \n                  (0.082) \n                \n                \n                  news_familypolitically_discordant\n                  0.078*  \n                \n                \n                                                   \n                  (0.039) \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.                         \n                  86      \n                \n                \n                  AIC                              \n                  38.4    \n                \n                \n                  BIC                              \n                  48.2    \n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you interpret this regression table?"
