# Hi!

I am Jan, a PhD student working on misinformation and trust in science.

More broadly, I'm interested in how people evaluate information, and what drives people to develop and propagate explanations about the world, including science, but also conspiracy theories, religion, or political ideology.

I'm supervised by [Hugo Mercier](https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/), and I am part of the [Evolution and Social Cognition team](https://esc.dec.ens.fr/en/evolution-and-social-cognition-members-10877).
